## 🛠 Tech Stack

| Technology   | Purpose                                 |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| Next.js      | React framework for SSR and client apps |

## 🎨 Theme & Styling

The project is configured to use daisyUI’s built-in **`dark` theme** by default, giving a sleek dark mode experience out of the box.  
You will find that components use classes like `bg-base-100`, `text-base-content`, `btn`, and so on — these styles adapt to the selected theme automatically.
